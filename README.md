# Pomodoro
A watchOS and iOS focus timer app

`Pomodoro` is a watchOS and iOS app that sets focus timers using the *Pomodoro Technique*.
The technique was
[developed](http://friend.ucsd.edu/reasonableexpectations/downloads/Cirillo%20--%20Pomodoro%20Technique.pdf)
by Francesco Cirillo in the '80s to *enhance focus*, *increase decision awareness*, *boost motivation*, and 
*alleviate mental fatigue*, among other benefits. Part of the technique is to break work into 25-minute intervals taking
5-minute breaks in between, then taking a more extended 30-minute break after 3-6 intervals.

Features:
- Set a sequential timer of up to 6 Pomodoro intervals that notify at each phase change 
- Label Pomodoro intervals with *tasks* to focus on
- Maintain a checklist of *tasks* and *projects*
- View and scrub through timer progress
- Check progress with iOS and watchOS widgets
- Pixel buddies 🍅🫐🍌
